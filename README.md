# Speech-Recognition-using-Vanilla-JavaScript

Hey, I'm Yash building a speech recognition app using vanilla JavaScript. Creating an exciting and interactive speech-based guessing game called "Day of the Game".

üéÆ Game Overview:
"Day of the Game" is a captivating guessing game where players use their voice to guess the word associated with a specific day of the week. By leveraging speech recognition technology, players can immerse themselves in a unique gaming experience.

üîß Technology Used:
We will harness the power of vanilla JavaScript, which means we will build the app without relying on external libraries or frameworks. This approach allows us to grasp the fundamental concepts and utilize the browser's built-in APIs for speech recognition.

üéôÔ∏è Speech Recognition Implementation:
The journey begins by constructing the HTML structure for the game interface. We will then delve into the JavaScript coding, employing the Web Speech API to handle speech recognition. Through this process, participants will learn how to capture and process user speech input, comparing it with the correct answer to determine if it matches.
